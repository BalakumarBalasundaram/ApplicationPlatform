Creating Jira stories to explore and understand the shared pipelines offered by an application platform involves breaking down the tasks into focused areas, such as reviewing documentation, hands-on experimentation, integration testing, and performance evaluation. Below is a set of stories tailored for this purpose:

1. Pipeline Documentation Review
Story:
As a DevOps engineer, I want to review the platform's shared pipeline documentation so that I can understand their functionality and configuration options.

Acceptance Criteria:

Access and read the documentation for shared pipelines.
Identify supported CI/CD tools and integrations.
List available pipeline templates and their use cases.
2. Hands-On Pipeline Configuration
Story:
As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure a shared pipeline on the platform so that I can understand the setup process and customization options.

Acceptance Criteria:

Set up a sample pipeline using a shared template.
Customize the pipeline to include build, test, and deploy stages.
Validate successful pipeline execution with logs and outputs.
3. Integration with Source Control
Story:
As a developer, I want to test the integration of shared pipelines with our source control system so that I can verify seamless integration for automated workflows.

Acceptance Criteria:

Connect the shared pipeline to a source control repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
Trigger the pipeline on code commits or pull requests.
Verify that pipeline stages execute correctly based on repository changes.
4. Pipeline Performance Evaluation
Story:
As a performance analyst, I want to measure the execution time of shared pipelines so that I can assess their efficiency for large-scale builds.

Acceptance Criteria:

Identify a representative build process for testing.
Execute the shared pipeline with different workload sizes.
Document the time taken for each pipeline stage and analyze performance metrics.
5. Security and Permissions Assessment
Story:
As a security analyst, I want to review the access controls and permissions for shared pipelines so that I can ensure secure usage across teams.

Acceptance Criteria:

Verify role-based access controls for pipeline creation and execution.
Test restrictions on pipeline editing and sensitive data (e.g., secrets, tokens).
Document security best practices for shared pipelines.
6. Integration with External Tools
Story:
As a DevOps engineer, I want to test the compatibility of shared pipelines with external tools so that I can ensure seamless integration with our existing tech stack.

Acceptance Criteria:

Integrate the shared pipeline with monitoring tools (e.g., Datadog, Prometheus).
Configure notifications for pipeline statuses (e.g., Slack, Teams, email).
Verify successful execution of the pipeline with external tool integration.
7. Customization Options
Story:
As a developer, I want to explore the customization options of shared pipelines so that I can adapt them to our project requirements.

Acceptance Criteria:

Modify pipeline templates to include custom build or deployment steps.
Add environment-specific configurations (e.g., dev, staging, production).
Verify that customizations execute as expected without errors.
8. Pipeline Scalability Testing
Story:
As a scalability analyst, I want to test the scalability of shared pipelines so that I can evaluate their performance under high workload conditions.

Acceptance Criteria:

Configure a pipeline to handle multiple concurrent builds.
Monitor resource usage during execution (e.g., CPU, memory).
Document how the platform manages scaling and throttling of pipelines.
9. Debugging and Troubleshooting
Story:
As a DevOps engineer, I want to test the debugging and troubleshooting features of shared pipelines so that I can handle errors effectively during execution.

Acceptance Criteria:

Intentionally introduce errors in the pipeline (e.g., failed tests, missing dependencies).
Use logs and platform tools to diagnose and resolve issues.
Document troubleshooting steps for common pipeline errors.
10. Cost and Resource Optimization
Story:
As a cost analyst, I want to review the cost implications of using shared pipelines so that I can optimize resource usage and minimize expenses.

Acceptance Criteria:

Analyze the platform’s pricing model for pipeline execution (e.g., pay-per-run, fixed cost).
Identify stages or steps that consume the most resources.
Suggest optimizations to reduce costs without compromising functionality.
11. Feedback and Documentation
Story:
As a technical writer, I want to document the findings and best practices for using shared pipelines so that the team has a reference for future projects.

Acceptance Criteria:

Summarize pipeline setup steps, configurations, and use cases.
Include examples of successful pipeline runs with screenshots or logs.
Share documentation with the team for review and feedback.
Organizing the Stories
Group these stories into epics for better tracking:

Exploring Pipeline Features
Integration and Compatibility
Performance and Scalability
Security and Cost Analysis
Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
By systematically addressing these stories, your team can thoroughly evaluate the shared pipelines, ensuring they meet your project’s requirements before moving forward.
